# HW-12 reinforce (2pts, due Jan 09)

Implement REINFORCE algorithm, representing a policy using a neural network with a hidden layer. Start with the labs10/reinforce-skeleton.py module.

You should be able to reach average reward of 475 on CartPole-v1 environment (using 500 steps) and -100 on Acrobot-v1 environment.
