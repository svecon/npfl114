# HW-12 monte_carlo (2pts, due Jan 02)

Implement Monte Carlo reinforcement learning algorithm, computing exact average for every state-action pair. Start with the labs10/monte_carlo-skeleton.py module.

You should be able to reach average reward of 475 on CartPole-v1 environment (using 500 steps).
